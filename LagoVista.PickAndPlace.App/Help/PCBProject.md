## Hold Down

Creating Drills for Hold Downs have two purposes, the first to hold the board in place so it doesn't move or slip while a drilling or milling operation is taking place.  The second is to allow accurate alignment while the board is flipped to mill the bottom side.  If this is not accurately aligned traces on the bottom may be milled so they are offset from the center of the drills and in the worst case make the board unusable.

##### Hole Diameter

The diameter of the hold that will be drilled into the PCB board to accomodate a pin or screw.  This should match as closely as possible to size of the actual pin or screw since any "slop" will result in potential offset between milling the Top and Bottom side of the boards
